# Predicting Phylogenetic Kingdom 
Short python notebook detailing the process of predicting phylogenetic kingdom using features such as relative codon expression.
Contents:  
* Data loading and preprocessing  
* Descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis  
* Handling class imbalances with SMOTE  
* KNN vs RandomForsest model experimentation  
* Experimentation with PCA vs manually engineered features for dimensionality reduction  
* Summary of results for 6 models in the 11 class classification problem
